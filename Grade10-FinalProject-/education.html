                <br>PTEC is an advanced technology program that allows high school students to learn skills within Software Development and Cybersecurity. They master these skills by participating in hands-on experiences, such as designing websites, making games, creating a network with multiple devices and assembling & disassembling hardware. This program provides a complete enriched experience with many professionals in the technology field coming to speak to the students and providing an interactive mentorship. During their final two years of high school, the PTEC students transfer their learning environment from SMART Park to MITT where they approach a more specific learning curriculum.</p>

                <br> Shaftesbury High School is my host school where I take my compulsory academic courses. In my final years at this school, I plan to take many interesting courses focused on technology and science, along with broadening my knowledge with the interesting world of psychology and law. I also plan to further indulge myself in the high school experience by participating in Shaftesburyâ€™s student council, as well as helping the community with the community outreach club. This high school is known for its elite hockey team and volleyball teams. GO TITANS, GO!</p>
