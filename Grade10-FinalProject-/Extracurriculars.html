                <br> <br> I learned how to swim by taking lessons. As I went through 10 levels, some of which I passed at RADY center, Pan Am pool and Univiersity of Manitoba aquatic centre.  I also participated in an advanced swimming group focusing on technique and skills. Now I have been working towards becoming a lifeguard by progressing through the National Lifeguard Program. </p>

                <br><br>I began when I did track in gym class starting from grade 4. Then I decided to continue on my school team after school hours. I focused on running events including the 100m, 300m, 400m and the 4 person relay race.Along with the running events I also practiced shot put and long jump. </p>
